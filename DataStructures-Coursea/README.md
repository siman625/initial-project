#### Programming Assignment 1: Basic Data Structures
##### 1 Problem: Check brackets in the code
Problem Introduction:
- In this problem you will implement a feature for a text editor to find errors in the usage of brackets in the
code.

Input Format: 
- Input contains one string S which consists of big and small latin letters, digits, punctuation marks and brackets from the set []{}().

Output Format: 
- If the code in S uses brackets correctly, output “Success” (without the quotes). Otherwise,
output the 1-based index of the first unmatched closing bracket, and if there are no unmatched closing brackets, output the 1-based index of the first unmatched opening bracket.

Sample:
- Input:  foo(bar[i);  Output:10
- Input:  {[]}();  Output: Success!
